Summary:
- This repository includes the machine learning class assignments I completed in the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at Texas Tech University.
- The assignments require the user to develop the algorithms from scratch meaning, there will either be very limited or no use of existing libraries. If 
- The assignments were written in MATLAB. I achieved a score of 100% in all 6 of the assignments.
- The assigments contain a mix of regression and classification algorithms. The contents of each assignment, including the algorithm utilized for solving the problem(s) is shared below under "Contents".

Reason for Sharing:
- I decided to make these assignments publicly available to help others learn the mathmetical principles of some of the core machine learning algorithms. 
- If the user is planning to use this repository for a class, I highly encourage the user to write their own code and use this repository as a supplementary resource.
- If the user is new to machine learning & is planning to use this repository to help with their Master's or PhD research, the contents of repository may not be directly/immediately helpful.
